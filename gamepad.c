we/* A USB joystick emulator for CSH's arcade controls.
 *
 * Based on some open source code from grunskis for USB joystick stuff on 
 * AVR/Teensy board, which was in turn based off PJRC's USB keyboard HID 
 * device code for Teensy boards. I've adapted it to add a ton of new buttons,
 * new axis, new HID descriptor, new AVR chip type to accomodate expanded pin
 * count need, etc.
